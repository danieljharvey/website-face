title: Typeclasses - Monad

The `Monad` is one of the most infamous things around Haskell, and the internet is full of tutorials about them. I wanted to avoid writing one, but it's difficult to talk about the other typeclasses without referring to it.

Anyhow, as an alternative to that, we're going to define the simplest possible `Monad`, and then look at some examples of them in action, and hopefully you'll see it's the properties of the different datatypes that make it interesting and give all the different behaviours.
