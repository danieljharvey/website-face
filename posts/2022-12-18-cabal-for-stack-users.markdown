title: Cabal for Stack users 
tags: haskell, stack, cabal 
---

`Cabal` and `Stack` are two tools for building Haskell projects. For a while, there
was only `Cabal`, and it has problems, and so `Stack`, a layer on top of `Cabal`, was
created to solve them. Perhaps embarrassed by this state of affairs, `Cabal` has
since improved, and now we have two great ways of building Haskell projects
(there is also `Nix`, which may very well be great, but I've never gotten it to
work on any non-trivial project).

When I started using Haskell, I tried both and `Stack` was the one that worked,
so a devoted `Stack` user I became.  Recently though, I've been using `Cabal` at work 
and found that learning how to talk directly to `Cabal` makes a lot of non-trivial tasks a
lot simpler than teaching `Stack` how to tell `Cabal` what to do (often via
`hpack`).

Therefore, here is a list of things I have had to translate, in case they are
helpful. This is by no means comprehensive (or even best practice) and I would
welcome any additions or corrections as I am very much still figuring this all
out.

### .gitignore / caching

You probably want to add these to your `.gitignore` folder and consider caching
them in CI.

Stack leaves all it's local junk in a folder called `.stack-work` and all it's
global builds in `~/.stack`.

Cabal leaves all it's local junk in a folder called `dist-newstyle` and all
it's global stuff in `~/.cabal`.


### Build a _thing_ 

(see "What are we building anyway?" for a hand wavy description of a `<thing>`)

Stack: `stack build <thing>`

Cabal: `cabal build <thing>`

### Find my compiled binary

Find out where compiled binaries went:

$(stack path --local-install-root --system-ghc)/bin"

$(cabal list-bin mimsa:exe:mimsa-server)"


Find out 'installed' binaries went:

stack:
~/.local/bin

cabal:
~/.cabal/bin



Local builds:
.stack-work

dist-newstyle



stack build -> cabal build

stack bench -> cabal bench


? -> cabal update


ghcid

ghcid -c "stack repl --test --bench" -l=hlint

ghcid -c "cabal repl mimsa:exe:mimsa-server" -l=hlint



build

stack build --test --no-run-tests --bench --no-run-benchmarks

cabal update
cabal build all


install

stack install --test --no-run-tests --bench --no-run-benchmarks

cabal update
cabal install mimsa:exe:mimsa --overwrite-policy=always

test-watch


stack test --file-watch --bench --no-run-benchmarks
ghcid -c "cabal repl mimsa:tests" -l=hlint --test="main"



test
stack test --bench --no-run-benchmarks
cabal update
	cabal run mimsa:test:mimsa-test

bench

stack bench --test --no-run-tests

cabal update
cabal bench




freezing

stack : package sets
cabal : freeze files
