title: Why the hell should I care about newtypes?
---

I had an epiphany recently when reading a nice blog explaining Coyoneda. I'd read many others but struggled to find the energy to care what the thing was, when I realise the reason was that the blog started with an explanation of the problem they were trying to solve.

Mindblowing.

It shouldn't be, but it often feels it is.

I know there's nothing wrong with interesting things for interesting's sake, and I suppose no writer owes anything to any reader really, especially on the internet where everything is just thoughts farted out into the breeze.

Anyway. I don't want to feel that way. I want to know useful things.

I think you have useful things.

Tell me why they're useful.

Anyway.

Blah.

Newtypes.

You see them in Haskell a lot.
