Hello. My name is Daniel J Harvey.
After arsing around doing various other things I have fallen into computers as a furtive source of both income and frustration.
My particular interests are in typed functional programming languages because I am a big fan of getting the compiler to do the hard work for me.
I intend to use this as a place to write things down in an attempt to better understand them myself.
If you are also trying to understand these things I hope they help in some way.
