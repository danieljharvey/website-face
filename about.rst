Hello. My name is Daniel J Harvey. After arsing around doing various other things I have fallen into computers as a furtive source of both income and frustration. My particular interests are in typed functional programming languages because I am a big fan of getting the compiler to do the hard work for me. I intend to use this as a place to put my thoughts on various subjects.
